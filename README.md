## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical concern for businesses, particularly in subscription-based services. This project leverages machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to leave, allowing companies to take proactive measures to improve retention.

---

## Problem Statement
Predict customer churn based on demographic, usage, and service-related data. The model should identify significant factors contributing to churn and help businesses devise strategies to reduce attrition.

---

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project includes:
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, etc.
- **Service Usage**: Monthly charges, contract type, tenure.
- **Account Information**: Payment method, number of services subscribed.
- **Churn Label**: Whether a customer churned (Yes/No).

**Shape**: (7043, 21)<br>
**Target Variable**: `Churn` (Binary: Yes/No)

---

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis.
   - Handling missing data, outliers, and skewness.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling numerical features.
   - Creating new derived features.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Experimented with models such as:
     - XGBoost
   - Evaluated using metrics like rsme, mae, r2

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python üêç
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data preprocessing)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
  - Scikit-learn, XGBoost (Machine Learning)
  - Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)
  - Docker (Containerization)
  - DVC (Version Control for Machine Learning)

---

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Deploy the model** (*Optional*):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

## Results and Insights
- Identified key factors influencing churn:
  - **Tenure**: Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn.
  - **Contract Type**: Month-to-month customers have a higher churn rate.
  - **Monthly Charges**: Higher charges correlate with increased churn risk.
- Visualized customer segments to target retention strategies.

---

## Future Scope
- Implement real-time churn prediction with streaming data.
- Deploy a web-based dashboard for business stakeholders.
- Expand analysis to include customer sentiment from reviews or support tickets.
